# you may get notified that your application is running slow on some parts.
# but the user doesn't know where is the part that has low speed.
# we need to save log of each function, we run in our application to understand which part takes time more than the other parts and why
# For this purpose, we should create a new table in our SQLite
# when we create the new table in our DB, there is no record on it. the record will be added to the table and DB by decorators we are going to use
# we will set the decorator in Common Layer. because we will use it in different layers
